# eightynine
## A monospace, stroked, inline SVG typeface.

Unlike traditional typefaces, Eightynine is a collection of unfilled vector paths. The font weight is determined by the width of the stroke, and each character can be freely transformed without the stroke being affected.

Eightynine is native to the web. Each character was drawn then converted to inline SVG, on a 3x3 grid so it plays as nicely as possible with anti-aliasing in traditional point sizes. 

The typeface is modern and geometric. The tall x-height and rounded corners disguise the lack of varying stroke weights. There are currently 94 characters following the UTF-8 standard.

Included is a large JS array containing each of the 94 characters as the innards of a <svg> tag.
